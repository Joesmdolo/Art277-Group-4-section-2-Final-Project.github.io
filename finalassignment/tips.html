                <P>"'Fully vaccinated' means that you completed a COVID-19 <br><br> vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against <br><br> severe complications such as hospitalizations and /or death. No <br><br> vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give <br><br> you better chance to fight off the infectous consequences of <br><br> being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus  </P>

                <h3>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?</h3>

                <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 maay occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don't have a good immune response to vacines. </p>

                <p>"The The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these Vulnerable population."</p>
