 <p>We've heard it all since the pandemic started - lemon juice can kill coronavirus, masks don't work, if you already had  <a href="#"><span style="color: yellow; text-decoration: 2px liquidb blue underline;"> COVID-19</span></a> you can't get it again or that the vaccines approved for emerchency use will change your DNA or put a tracking in your body. <br><a style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:davisjeremie051@gmail.com"><span>Send Us Email</span></a>  </p>

<p>It's almost like we need a strong dose of something to to knock out all of the misinformation. But despie all the myths and urban legends, about half of the <abbr>U.S.</abbr>  population is fully vaccinated. <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpfOC2oWPAA?t=18" width="350px" height="180px" style="float: right;position: static; top: 1%;" title="youtube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Wounderful news, right? Wounderful news, right?  </p>


<p>Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a new set of myths-they are literally magnetic or they're going to shed vaccine components and alter DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.</p>

<p>So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is still possible for thhem to spread COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <span style=" color: yellow; text-decoration: 2px solid blue underline;" >Lyssette Cardona</span>, MD, answer those question and cover why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19. <br> <br>
    isn't the time to let your guard down.While the vaccine are potten, there's a still a chance that you could become infected. <br><br>
    Dr. Cardona explains. </p>
